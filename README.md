The code is fairly well documented so I will save you the hour long explaination and cut to the chase.

This project is essentially an "Order a coffee" app. Some things are built the way they are built for 
assessment and not because I wanted to build them in that way or because they are correct. I spent
A week building and debugging, then realising ive missed some marking points and reconstructing it.
I feel if i wasnt coding in java nor if I was trying to program in an oop way (the whole point of the class)
Then I think I could have finished this pretty fast, but bending my mind to oop principals took a 
little longer then I want to admit. This semester has been crazy so far, so much math and not alot of
programming.... I will ty to step up the programming in the second half as well as in the three
month break I have after sem.... big programs to come.... dont know why this just turned into a blog
post...
